          <p>I'm currently learning about gene retention in mitochondria and maybe eventually do a PhD in the field. But for now I've taken a year off to learn and work out on what I <em>really</em> want.</p>
          <p>I'm also working on a few projects, including this website, and a research project on mitochondrial genetics.</p>
          <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading about science, fiction, and playing guitar. Some of which can be found <a href="Links.html">here</a>.</p>
