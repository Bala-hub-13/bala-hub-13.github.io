            <p>This is going to be long, and this would grow up in time. So read at your leisure...</p>
            <p>Childhood, rarely do we see the innocence of childhood as a gift, that feeling of the worst fear in your life was &#39;failing a subject&#39;, the stakes pretty high, back then. At least, in my life.<br>No, I&#39;m not feeling nostalgic or melodramatic that it was gone.<br>But the realisation that how small that world was, only your school, neighbourhood, and the occasional trips. Yet how filled in that world was!<br>Banters, pranks, tournaments, and exams. You hate up showing on Monday, but only until you see your friend, then it would be all fun. I wonder that&#39;s how everybody felt! There were incidents that supports this, we would message others, letting them know in advance of our absence. This results in a particular ring of friends being absent.<br>Jealously was rarely visible, factions made up for diversity, most offensive thing was foul language.</p>
            <p>I would wait eagerly for the evening Basketball practise, wondering at how could someone (coach) easily take a three pointer, I remember the time when he would be conversing with us and just a glance towards the board and &#39;whoosh&#39; the sound of his shooting action so soft, it feels like a breeze on a sunny yet partly cloudy day.<br>And the thing that was my addiction back then, the sound of the ball going through the net without touching the back-board or the rim of the net.<br>That was an audio-visual odyssey. And only some feel and enjoy it. I call it the &quot;Ring shot&quot;.</p>
            <p>That is when we learnt to be different in our trigger movement, lay-up or lay-in, jump shot.<br>These would become our identity, our special move. All of us trying different things at our drill session.<br>Fridays would be a full 1-hour jog. Saturday is what everyone looks forward; game day.<br>I have this memory of a match in my fifth or sixth grade, the referee was my P.T, I got a pass near the half-court and I dribbled down to our attacking post, I told him that I would convert this shot, It was a lay-up, I always had a sweet spot for it; even though I rarely ever use it later at my life.<br>There is something so essentially different from lay-up and lay-in.<br>It&#39;s a whole different feel when you go for a lay-up; one shows the ball in his palm to the post, almost like an offer of the kindest intention. You don&#39;t make any noise, neither does the board.<br>Yep, I made that shot!</p>
