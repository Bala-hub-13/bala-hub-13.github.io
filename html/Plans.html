                <p>Plans are our favorite delusion, tiny, and hand drawn sketches(more like "blueprints") for how the universe should behave...<em>only if it weren’t so busy laughing</em>. From five-year life goals to “when should I snack on Maggi?”, plans exist primarily to give structure to chaos(Maybe It's indeed a ladder). The moment you declare a plan out loud, the universe marks it for destruction, like it’s been flagged by airport security or targeted by Jason Bateman.</p>
                <p>Friends make vacation plans they’ll cancel via text, governments make climate plans they’ll ignore while drilling new holes in the planet, or busy making grounds for MNCs and we(students) make study plans that live and die inside our color-coded planners. Meanwhile, productivity apps grow fat feeding on our broken dreams and weekly goals. The potential was off the charts. The execution? Yeah, not so much. And yet we persist, building sandcastles out of bullet points and acting surprised when the tide of reality wipes them out.</p>
                <p class="blockquote">Maybe next time I make a plan, I’ll just add a footnote “Subject to chaos.”</p>
                <p>You should too. (Unless, of course, you’re that perfectly planned-out dude who’s got it all figured out. In which case, good luck with that.)</p>
                <p>Plans: because lying to ourselves feels so organized.</p>
                <p class="blockquote">“Invest in preparedness; not in prediction.” said Nassim Nicholas Taleb</p>
                <p> We don't try to predict the future, we brace for the impact. Like, how many times that we have planned a thing only for it to be hit in the head by an unexplainable event. That unexplainable wouldn't have crossed our mind even when one tries to rationally look for all the possible things that could spoil the PLAN. This kind of event is what Taleb calls a ‘Black Swan' and yes, he literally wrote a book on it. Highly recommended if you enjoy intelligent doom reading. Black Swan events always happen and yet, we have this talent for retroactively <em>pretending</em> they made sense all along. Like, 'Oh yeah, of course that tariffs ruined my goa plans. Totally predictable.’</p>
                <p>But, it is totally fine for something to destroy your schedule, cause now you're caught off-guard and how are you gonna trust yourself when there is no stars to guide you but YOU.</p>
                <p>P.S. This felt off, I would like to revise it in the future. Planning to, at least.</p>
