        <p>“And our differences?” Elend asked.</p>
        <p>“At first glance, the key and the lock it fits may seem very different,” Sazed said. “Different in shape, different in function, different in design. The man who looks at them without knowledge of their true nature might think them opposites, for one is meant to open, and the other to keep closed. Yet, upon closer examination, he might see that without one, the other becomes useless. The wise man then sees that both the lock and key were created for the same purpose.”</p>

        Albert Camus, The Myth of Sisyphus
      </section>
      <section class="content">
        <p>I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain! One always finds one's burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.</p>

        Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene

      <section class="content">
        <p>Be warned that when we give up our 'selfish' ways in favor of altruism, we are often still driven by selfish motives. The impulse to help others might, in the end, be helping ourselves by helping close relatives or even our future descendants.</p>

        <p>Empires do not suffer emptiness of purpose at the time of their creation. It is when they have become established that aims are lost and replaced by vague rituals.<br>

        <p>Ten thousand times the web could be destroyed, and ten thousand times the spider would rebuild it. There was neither annoyance nor despair, nor any delight, just as it had been for a billion years.</p>

        <p>Genes are the architects of life, but they are not the only architects. They interact with the environment, with other genes, and with our free will. We are not simply the sum of our genes; we are also the sum of the forces that act upon them.</p>
