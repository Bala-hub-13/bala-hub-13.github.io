          <h2>Who am I? and  What is this site about?</h2>
          <p>I’m Bala and I'm a Bioscience graduate, fixated on gene retention(rather, the absence of it). And this site was intended to be a glimpse of my interests. To help me with having all the digital elements in one place. Obsidian was good, it still is. but the visualization aspect of it wasn't to my liking. So that's where this site comes in. I want to build this site for the long future ahead, where I can trace back my ideas, digital notes(not in the near future), and projects. Heck, my entire digital footprint.</p>
          <p>Kinda like a Digital Garden, but it’s a work in progress, so expect changes. This site was well <em>intended</em> for me. Hey you can take a look around!</p>
