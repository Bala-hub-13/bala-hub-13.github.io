          <h2>Who am I? and  What is this site about?</h2>
          <p>Disclaimer: It is easy to ask who one is but rarely does one tries to look into it and put out a congolmeration of who one is. It is tedious; oblivion is much more <em>safe</em> or easy path for many. But not knowing thyself, What a waste!</p>
          <p>I’m Bala, a Bioscience graduate fascinated by gene retention(or rather, the absence of it).</p>
          <p>This site is meant to be a glimpse of my interests. A place to collect and explore ideas that matter to me. Obsidian was great(still is), but I wanted more control to how everything looked and felt.</p>
          <p>So that's where this site comes in. A digital notebook for the long future ahead, where I can dump my ideas, content that I find amusing, digital notes(not just yet, but someday), and projects. Heck, my entire digital footprint.</p>
          <p>But it’s a work in progress, so expect changes.</p>
