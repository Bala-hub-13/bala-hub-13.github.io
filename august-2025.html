        <h3>Morning</h3>
          <p>Days began with an alarm. Stretched a bit to get myself moving and not to feel like a “folded lawn chair” at the sight of the bed. I drank some water, felt it sloshing in my empty stomach. Toothbrush in hand, I  peeked out my doorway like a detective. Who was that? Huh, you tree. Morning!<br>Safe, clear to proceed. On my left was the staircase leading up.<br>I sat on the chair and brushed my teeth, the time read &#39;5:45&#39;.<br>Afterward I went downstairs, splashed some water on my eyes, grabbed my laptop, and climbed back up: like I never left.</p>
          <p>Started reading Derrida’s work (secondary source; don&#39;t judge).  And the usual avian opera began. Cuckoos, squeals; maybe squirrels auditioning? Before all this was the rooster&#39;s morning cliche. Confirming the legends!</p>
          <p>Here comes the red orb, but now it was yellowish orange. It painted the horizon, oddly dimming as the glare faded though.<br>It grazed my right eye; not sliding smoothly but stuttering forward, like the whole star was moving in quantized steps.<br>Not impressed. </p>
          <h3>What I did</h3>
          <p>Dipped my hands into flour, made dough, got sheets, made volcanoes filled with egg whites. At least I was able to get an edible lasagna. Pastas at other times. Made all kinds of milkshakes I liked.<br>Cooking is fun, preparatory but fun. I&#39;ve to stop myself from eating half of it before it reaches the table.<br>And the peace of drinking ginger tea with the looming sunset; with all its saturated glory. </p>
          <p><em>Books</em></p>
          <ul>
          <li>The Mistborn Trilogy</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>Series &amp; Movies</em></p>
          <ul>
          <li>Andor - Best thing to come out of Star wars. </li>
          <li>Peaky Blinders -  Season 1 &amp; 2; so far so good.</li>
          <li>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy - Is he dead or is that a flashback, Have to read the book someday.</li>
          <li>Conclave - It didn&#39;t have to look that beautiful and why does this has to be some kind of a thriller; they did take them too seriously.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>What I learnt</h3>
          <p>I went through Molecular Biology and a little bit of Biochemistry.<br>Can say I know how to make a decent looking maximal minimalist webpage, I used CS50&#39;s <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/">course</a> to get started and one can always find other good resources. So did I.</p>
          <p>Started reading some papers on Mitochondrial gene retention and so far it&#39;s been good and wonderful.<br> Somehow went through Wittgenstein, godel and stumbled on derrida and I have mixed views; working on a long form essay but the gist is <a href="Something">here</a>.</p>
          <p>See you on the eve of next month...</p>
