            <h3>Morning</h3>
              <p>Days began with an alarm. Stretched a bit to get myself moving and not to feel like a “folded lawn chair” at the sight of the bed. I drank some water, felt it sloshing in my empty stomach.<br> Toothbrush in hand, I  peeked out my doorway like a detective. Who was that? Huh, you tree. Morning!<br>Safe, clear to proceed. On my left was the staircase leading up.<br>I sat on the chair and brushed my teeth. The time read &#39;5:45&#39;.<br>Afterward I went downstairs, splashed some water on my eyes, grabbed my laptop, and climbed back up, like I never left.</p>
              <p>Started reading Derrida’s work (secondary source; don&#39;t judge).  And the usual avian opera began. Cuckoos, squeals; maybe squirrels auditioning? Before all this was the rooster&#39;s morning cliche. Confirming the legends!</p>
              <p>Here comes the red orb, but now it is yellowish orange. It painted the horizon, oddly dimming as the glare faded though. It grazed my right eye, not sliding smoothly but stuttering forward, like the whole star was moving in quantized steps.<br>Not impressed. </p>

            <h3>What I did</h3>
              <p>Dipped my hands into flour, made dough, got sheets, made volcanoes filled with egg whites. At least I was able to get an edible lasagna.<br> Pastas at other times. Made all kinds of milkshakes I liked.<br>Cooking is fun, preparatory but fun. I&#39;ve to stop myself from eating half of it before it reaches the table.<br>And the peace of drinking ginger tea with the looming sunset; with all its saturated glory. </p>
              <p><em>Books</em></p>
              <ul>
              <li>The Mistborn Trilogy</li>
              </ul>
              <p><em>Series &amp; Movies</em></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Andor - Best thing to come out of Star Wars. </li>
              <li>Peaky Blinders -  Season 1 &amp; 2; so far so good.</li>
              <li>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy - Is he dead or is that a flashback; that was done delicately. Have to read the book someday.</li>
              <li>Conclave - It didn&#39;t have to look that beautiful and why does this has to be some kind of a thriller; they did take themselves too seriously.</li>
              </ul>
            <h3>What I learnt</h3>
              <p>I went through Molecular Biology and a little bit of Biochemistry.<br>Can say I know how to make a decent looking maximal minimalist webpage, I used CS50&#39;s <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">course (ext)</a> to get started and one can always find other good resources. So did I.</p>
              <p>Started reading some papers on Mitochondrial gene retention and so far it&#39;s been good and wonderful.<br> Somehow went through Wittgenstein, Gödel and stumbled on Derrida and I do have mixed views; working on a long form essay but the gist is <a href="Futility.html">here</a>.</p>
              <p>Hey! I practiced 'Iris' by the Goo Goo Dolls, 'Yellow' by Coldplay and 'No surprises' &amp; 'Exit music (for a film)' by Radiohead on guitar.<br>
               Below are some recordings, at least I don't have to vouch for their <em>authenticity</em>; the awfulness would do. Mind the noises, not mine though.</p><!--Unless it's guitar, in which case it's perfectly mine! -->
